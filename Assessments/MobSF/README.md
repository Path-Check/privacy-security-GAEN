# Assessment Summary
Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. MobSF support mobile app binaries (APK, IPA & APPX) along with zipped source code and provides REST APIs for seamless integration with your CI/CD or DevSecOps pipeline. The Dynamic Analyzer helps you to perform runtime security assessment and interactive instrumented testing.

# Scope
Version 1.15.0 (IOS & Android)

# Result
MobSF static code analysis discovered no vulnerabilities that impact the security of the gaen-mobile application. PathCheck reviewed all results and they were either eliminated as false positives, expected due to Apple/Google GAEN requirements, or did not present a risk to the application or data.
